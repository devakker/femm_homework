## howto

The helper class in the geo.py file is needed for the scripts so they should be ran like this:

1. Install femmm
2. Install Python 3.8+
3. Install vscode with the recommended extensions
4. Create a virtualenv in the project root `py -m venv venv'
5. Open this folder in vscode and select the virtualenv as the python interpreter
6. Open a terminal in vscode (this will activate the venv) and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Scripts should be able to run by pressing F5 when they're open
