# This program consider an axisymmetric magnetostatic problem
# of a cylindrical coil with an axial length of 100 mm, an
# inner radius of 50 mm, and an outer radius of 100 mm.  The
# coil has 200 turns and the coil current is 20 Amps. There is
# an iron bar 80 mm long with a radius of 10 mm centered co-
# axially with the coil.  The objective of the analysis is to
# determine the flux density at the center of the iron bar,
# and to plot the field along the r=0 axis. This analysis
# defines a nonlinear B-H curve for the iron and employs an
# asymptotic boundary condition to approximate an "open"
# boundary condition on the edge of the solution domain.
